      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>
        This website, created for the WEB222 course, showcases a dynamic, responsive design emphasizing user experience
        across various devices. It features a product gallery, an about page, and an honesty policy statement. The focus
        of this project is to demonstrate skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design. The product gallery, a key
        highlight, offers an engaging and visually appealing display of items, ensuring ease of navigation. The about
        page provides insights into the website's purpose, while the honesty policy emphasizes our commitment to
        transparency. This project not only fulfills academic requirements but also serves as a practical example of the
        web development skills learned in the course.
